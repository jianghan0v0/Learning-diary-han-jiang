# Week_7 Google Earth Engine

## Introduction

"Geospatial" processing service, which permits geospatial analysis **at scale.** Where scale means massive datasets, planetary sclae analysis and fast. GEE stores data on servers so that it can be used to make queryable online applications. Literally, anything that has ee in front of it is stored on the server, which termed "proxy objects". In addition, techniques for loading and filtering image collections, geometries, and features are covered. Methods for reducing images (including zonal statistics), applying regression over time, and using joins to combine datasets are explored.

## Practical

**PCA is a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most variability.**

1.  PCA in GEE: PCA is usually performed in GEE to reduce the dimensionality of remote sensing data and to highlight key information about land cover, change detection, or other environmental features.

2.  PCA in R: Compared with GEE, the data processing capability of R is limited by local computing resources. While R can handle big data, dealing with particularly large data sets may require optimizing code or using specific packages such as bigmemory or ff to manage memory usage.

3.  Although PCA in GEE and R are used for data reduction and feature extraction, GEE is more suitable for processing large-scale remote sensing image data and geospatial analysis, while R provides more flexible data processing and statistical analysis tools, which are suitable for various types of data.

## Extracurricular Study

In this week, to better understand how UHI affect cities and i want to figure out how to deal with that, so here I list several ways toitigate the urban heat island effects.

### Action Map

The professional articulation of the action plan derived from the dataset informed by remote sensing analysis could be stated as follows:

**Sustainable Construction Initiatives**:

-   Newly constructed edifices will integrate eco-friendly design principles, targeting certification under the Green Building Environmental Assessment, known as "BEAM Plus," to ensure environmental sustainability and operational efficiency.

**Urban Retrofitting Strategies**:

-   Revitalization projects will involve retrofitting pedestrian pathways and the external surfaces of structures with high-albedo materials, effectively diminishing the surrounding microclimate temperatures through increased solar reflectance.

**Public Space Enhancement Measures**:

-   Infrastructure in densely populated zones and commercial complexes will be augmented with heat mitigation features, including but not limited to pergolas, water features, expansive waterfront promenades, misting systems, and solar-powered evaporative cooling fans.

**Community Welfare and Support Services**:

-   The deployment of sprinkler systems and the provision of public swimming facilities will be instituted as recreational cooling measures. Additionally, a subsidy program will be implemented to offset the cost of air conditioning for eligible individuals, promoting social equity during extreme temperature events.

**Environmental Conservation and Greening Efforts**:

-   An increase in the number of verdant thoroughfares will be pursued, enhancing the urban canopy and vegetation density. This will be complemented by an ambitious urban forestry initiative aimed at the establishment and expansion of parklands to foster biodiversity, improve air quality, and enhance the urban dwellers' quality of life.

These strategic measures align with contemporary urban resilience and sustainability frameworks, aiming to holistically address the urban heat island phenomenon and promote a healthier, more sustainable urban environment.

Then I collect them and make one **Hazard-Vulnerability Risk** Map.
