## Introduction

"Geospatial" processing service, which permits geospatial analysis **at scale.** Where scale means massive datasets, planetary sclae analysis and fast. GEE stores data on servers so that it can be used to make queryable online applications. Literally, anything that has ee in front of it is stored on the server, which termed "proxy objects". In addition, techniques for loading and filtering image collections, geometries, and features are covered. Methods for reducing images (including zonal statistics), applying regression over time, and using joins to combine datasets are explored.

## Practical

**PCA is a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most variability.**

1.  PCA in GEE: PCA is usually performed in GEE to reduce the dimensionality of remote sensing data and to highlight key information about land cover, change detection, or other environmental features.

2.  PCA in R: Compared with GEE, the data processing capability of R is limited by local computing resources. While R can handle big data, dealing with particularly large data sets may require optimizing code or using specific packages such as bigmemory or ff to manage memory usage.

3.  Although PCA in GEE and R are used for data reduction and feature extraction, GEE is more suitable for processing large-scale remote sensing image data and geospatial analysis, while R provides more flexible data processing and statistical analysis tools, which are suitable for various types of data.


## Further study: Classification on NDVI 
NDVI Visualization: The first image shows a color-coded NDVI representation where different shades of green likely indicate vegetation health, with darker greens representing healthier or denser vegetation. This visualization can help identify vegetated areas and assess their condition.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics('https://github.com/jianghan0v0/Learning-diary-han-jiang/raw/main/images/wk7-ndvi1.png')
```

NDVI Thresholding: The second image, displaying NDVI thresholds, likely applies a grayscale where the intensity corresponds to NDVI values. An accompanying histogram shows the distribution of these values, which can be used to set thresholds for categorizing land cover into vegetation types or health classes.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics('https://github.com/jianghan0v0/Learning-diary-han-jiang/raw/main/images/wk7-ndvi2.png')
```

NDVI Gradient: The third image shows the gradient of NDVI, highlighting areas of significant change between adjacent pixels. This can be used to detect edges and transitions between different land covers, which is particularly useful in defining boundaries in the classification process.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics('https://github.com/jianghan0v0/Learning-diary-han-jiang/raw/main/images/wk7-ndvi3.png')
```

Together, these images usually form an analytical approach to classify land cover based on vegetation presence and health, utilizing NDVI as a key index for differentiating between vegetation types and conditions.
