### LULC

LULC stands for Land Use and Land Cover. It refers to the classification of the Earth's surface into different categories based on how the land is used by humans (such as residential, agricultural, industrial) and the natural cover present on the land (like forests, water bodies, deserts).

### SAR(Synthetic Aperture Radar)

-   High-resolution radar system.

-   Mounted on aircraft or satellites.

-   Uses microwave signals, receives reflections.

-   Functions in all weather, day and night.

-   Applications: terrain mapping, environmental monitoring, agriculture, forestry, urban planning, disaster assessment.

-   Penetrates vegetation, some surface materials.

-   Provides in-depth ground information, complementing optical satellites.

### SAR polarization

-   Single = 1 horizontal (or vertical)

-   Dual = transmits and receives both horizontal and vertical

-   HH = emitted in horizontal (H) and received in horizontal (H)


## Workshop-Temperature
In my exploration of the urban temperature analysis practical on the provided webpage, I've engaged with methods for processing temperature data from Landsat and MODIS imagery using Google Earth Engine. This includes converting temperature from Kelvin to Celsius, applying scale factors, and masking out certain values. The complexity of handling large datasets with high temporal resolution, such as MODIS, stands out as a technical challenge. Moreover, ensuring accurate results when merging different data collections and performing time-series analysis adds layers of difficulty.

The hands-on practice with code provided a practical understanding of these remote sensing techniques, with a focus on analyzing temperature variations over time and across different urban areas. This has been an insightful exercise in managing and interpreting complex spatial data to understand urban climates.
## Further Practice-Flood Detection
According to practical case study([Google Earth Engine: Analyzing Land Surface Temperature Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WDxMR5UpxqiTB4GsJcdP9AB0hP-Z8oaX-O9akBg2PZ0/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt)), which focused on analyzing land surface temperature (LST) data using Google Earth Engine (GEE) with MODIS imagery, I've learned about the significance of MODIS, which provides images in 36 spectral bands and has been doing so since the year 2000. This tool is essential for understanding LST trends, which can be used for climate change studies and agricultural planning. 

To further study the use of GEE, I analyzed a flood detection algorithm using GEE([Flood-Detection](https://github.com/Mahyarona/Flood-Detection-Algorithm-using-GEE/blob/master/README.pdf)) and related it to the previous learnings about Land Surface Temperature (LST).

The visuals display different areas affected by flooding and their impact on populations, with colors indicating the severity. This case study, like the LST one, demonstrates the power of GEE in analyzing environmental phenomena. Itâ€™s intriguing to see how satellite data can be used to inform on ground conditions that directly affect people's lives. While processing and interpreting this data requires careful attention to ensure accuracy, the potential applications in disaster management and planning are profound. The histogram represents backscatter values from SAR imagery, crucial in distinguishing flooded areas, a methodology that shares parallels with LST data handling in discerning temperature variations. Both exercises deepen my understanding of remote sensing's capabilities in environmental monitoring.
