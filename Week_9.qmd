### SAR(Synthetic Aperture Radar)

-   High-resolution radar system.

-   Mounted on aircraft or satellites.

-   Uses microwave signals, receives reflections.

-   Functions in all weather, day and night.

-   Applications: terrain mapping, environmental monitoring, agriculture, forestry, urban planning, disaster assessment.

-   Penetrates vegetation, some surface materials.

-   Provides in-depth ground information, complementing optical satellites.

### SAR polarization

-   Single = 1 horizontal (or vertical)

-   Dual = transmits and receives both horizontal and vertical

-   HH = emitted in horizontal (H) and received in horizontal (H)
