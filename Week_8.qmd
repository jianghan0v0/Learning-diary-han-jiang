## Summary

Week 9 focuses on flood detection using remote sensing and GEE. It explores the utilization of MODIS and SAR data to monitor flood events, emphasizing the interpretation of these datasets to assess flood impact. The lecture covers the importance of understanding spectral signatures associated with floods, especially in terms of backscatter in SAR data, which is key in differentiating flooded from non-flooded areas.

### Backscatter in SAR

**Definition**: Refers to the portion of the radar signal that is reflected back to the SAR satellite from Earth's surface.

1.  **Flood Detection**: Utilizes the contrast in backscatter between water and land; water surfaces typically appear dark in SAR imagery due to low backscatter.

2.  **Surface Interaction**: The intensity of backscatter is influenced by surface roughness and moisture levels; smoother surfaces like water bodies tend to have lower backscatter.

3.  **Advantages of SAR**:

    -   **Cloud Penetration**: Can acquire data in all weather conditions, essential for timely flood monitoring.

    -   **Illumination Independence**: Capable of data collection during both day and night.

### SAR vs. LST

-   LST measures the temperature of the Earth's surface, valuable for studying climate change, urban heat islands, and agriculture.

-   SAR is a form of radar imagery that can penetrate cloud cover and is not dependent on sunlight, making it ideal for monitoring Earth's surface in any weather and lighting conditions. SAR is particularly useful for detecting structural changes, such as deforestation, floods, and earthquakes, due to its ability to measure surface roughness.

The key difference lies in LST providing thermal information, while SAR offers structural details.

## Application-Temperature(LST)

In my exploration of the urban temperature analysis practical on the provided webpage, I've engaged with methods for processing temperature data from Landsat and MODIS imagery using Google Earth Engine. This includes converting temperature from Kelvin to Celsius, applying scale factors, and masking out certain values. The complexity of handling large datasets with high temporal resolution, such as MODIS, stands out as a technical challenge. Moreover, ensuring accurate results when merging different data collections and performing time-series analysis adds layers of difficulty.

The hands-on practice with code provided a practical understanding of these remote sensing techniques, with a focus on analyzing temperature variations over time and across different urban areas. This has been an insightful exercise in managing and interpreting complex spatial data to understand urban climates.

## Application-Flood-Detection(SAR)

According to practical case study([Google Earth Engine: Analyzing Land Surface Temperature Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WDxMR5UpxqiTB4GsJcdP9AB0hP-Z8oaX-O9akBg2PZ0/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt)), which focused on analyzing land surface temperature (LST) data using GEE with MODIS imagery, I've learned about the significance of MODIS, which provides images in 36 spectral bands and has been doing so since the year 2000. This tool is essential for understanding LST trends, which can be used for climate change studies and agricultural planning.

To further study the use of GEE, I analyzed a flood detection algorithm with SAR imagry([Flood-Detection](https://github.com/Mahyarona/Flood-Detection-Algorithm-using-GEE/blob/master/README.pdf)).

The visuals display different areas affected by flooding and their impact on populations, with colors indicating the severity. This case study, like the LST one, demonstrates the power of GEE in analyzing environmental phenomena. It's intriguing to see how satellite data can be used to inform on ground conditions that directly affect people's lives. While processing and interpreting this data requires careful attention to ensure accuracy, the potential applications in disaster management and planning are profound. The histogram represents backscatter values from SAR imagery, crucial in distinguishing flooded areas.

In Stefan's essay, I found this image presented appears to be from a study utilizing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for flood mapping, specifically concerning the Severn and Avon Rivers area. It showcases the use of SAR imagery in vertical transmit-vertical receive (VV) polarization for detecting and analyzing flood events.

The application of SAR in flood issues exemplifies how remote sensing technologies can provide critical, timely, and actionable data. The ability to monitor and rapidly assess flooding extends beyond academic research to practical implications, such as informing rescue operations, aiding in the strategic deployment of resources, and planning for long-term flood mitigation measures. This study not only contributes to the field of remote sensing but also demonstrates a concrete example of how data from space can have a significant impact on human safety and environmental management.

## Reflection

This week, I delved into analyzing LST data and SAR imagery for flood detection. I encountered challenges in discerning accurate temperature readings amidst urban heat islands and interpreting backscatter variations in SAR data to identify flood extents. Through this process, I've learned the intricacies of remote sensing applications and the value of integrating different data sources for environmental monitoring. Both exercises deepen my understanding of remote sensing's capabilities in environmental monitoring. It was enlightening to see the contrast between the thermal data provided by LST and the structural details from SAR, enhancing my understanding of how multifaceted Earth observation can be.
