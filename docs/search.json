    "text": "Introduction\n\n\n\nHello! I’m HAN JIANG. I’m currently pursuing my graduate studies at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) at UCL, marking my first foray into postgraduate education. My journey at UCL has been enriching, having completed courses in the Foundations of Spatial Data Science, Geographic Information Systems, Urban Systems Theory, Science, and Quantitative Methods. I’m currently delving into Remote Sensing, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), Data Science, and Building Spatial Applications with Big Data, which are broadening my perspective and skill set in the spatial sciences.\nI graduated in 2023 with a Bachelor’s degree from a collaborative program between Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Queen Mary University of London in E-commerce Engineering with Law. My undergraduate studies encompassed a diverse array of subjects including Advanced Network Programming, Engineering Mathematics, Discrete Mathematics, Advanced Mathematics, Telecommunications Engineering, Web Front-end Design, Databases, and Macroeconomics.\nMy internship experiences have been equally diverse and enriching. In 2022, I interned at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I was involved in projects related to Monkey Behavior Image Recognition and Mouse Behavior Recording, focusing mainly on video data annotation and model testing. In 2023, I took up a community operations role at EasyTransfer, where my primary responsibility was addressing and resolving user product inquiries and issues.\nOn a lighter note, here’s a bit more about me beyond academics and work: I’m a Leo born in the 2000s with an ENTP personality type. My hobbies include visiting parks (easy to get tired), exploring museums (easy to get lost), enjoying a drink (easy to be drunk), indulging in gourmet food (on a budget), and watching musicals (even as I struggle with English). I’ve been trying to become a blogger, but I have very few followers. I love dogs, especially my HuanHuan, who is 10 years old now. I miss her so much."

Here are how EM waves interact with Specific Atmospheric Components:\n-Water Vapor: Absorbs infrared and microwave radiation, playing a significant role in the Earth’s energy balance.\n-Ozone: Absorbs most of the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation, protecting living organisms.\n-Aerosols and Particulates: Scatter and absorb sunlight, which can cool the surface or contribute to atmospheric warming, depending on their properties."

    "text": "1.3 Practical Applications\n\n1.3.1 Introduction to Tools:\n1. Loading Landsat and Sentinel Data\n\nLandsat and Sentinel are two different Earth observation satellite programs. The Landsat program is managed jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA and has been operational since 1972, making it the longest-running enterprise for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. The Sentinel program is part of the European Space Agency (ESA) and supports the European Union’s Copernicus program, providing a wide range of data for environmental and security monitoring.\nLoading the data involves retrieving these satellites’ imagery from databases or storage services. This may include specifying certain criteria like specific dates, areas of interest, cloud cover percentage, etc., to filter the data.\n\n2. Selecting Regions of Interest (ROIs)\n\nSelecting Regions of Interest (ROIs) is the process of identifying areas for focused analysis within the vast amounts of remote sensing data. These areas might be selected based on specific geographic features, ecosystems, urban areas, etc.\nROIs can be selected by manually drawing polygons, entering geographic coordinates, or using existing geographic information data (like vector layers). This step is crucial to ensure that subsequent analyses are concentrated on relevant areas.\n\n3. Plotting Spectral Signatures\n\nSpectral signatures refer to the characteristic pattern of reflection or absorption of light at different wavelengths by objects or materials. In remote sensing, analyzing the spectral reflectance of different terrestrial materials (like vegetation, water bodies, soil, etc.) allows for their identification and classification.\nPlotting spectral signatures involves graphically representing these spectral characteristics, typically showing wavelength (or bands) against reflectance values. This helps in understanding the spectral behavior of different materials, which is vital for applications like material classification, vegetation health analysis, etc.\nApplications of Remote Sensing: Covers urban/green space coverage, pollution studies, illegal logging, forest fires, temperature studies, flooding, disaster response, and building footprints analysis."

It underscores the complexity and richness of remotely sensed data, advocating for a nuanced approach to data interpretation and application in various geographical and environmental studies.\n\n\n\n3.1.7 Summary\nThis lecture provides a comprehensive overview of the techniques and challenges involved in processing remote sensing data. Through detailed explanations of correction methods, data joining techniques, and enhancements, students gain insights into the meticulous work required to transform raw satellite imagery into valuable information for a wide range of applications."

The meticulous task of identifying Ground Control Points and minimizing the RMSE to align distorted images to a geospatial reference resonates deeply with my penchant for detail and accuracy. It’s a reminder of the delicate balance between the abstract concepts taught in academia and their concrete applications in real-world scenarios. Jensen’s texts offer not only a theoretical framework but also practical solutions that bridge this gap, making the leap from understanding to application less daunting and more attainable. My future endeavors in this field will undoubtedly be influenced by the rich insights gained from this week’s focus, urging me to delve further into geometric corrections to elevate the reliability and utility of spatial data analysis."

From a government perspective, taking steps to mitigate the heat island effect would not only help combat climate change, but could also lead to economic savings, such as energy savings through reduced air conditioning use and lower healthcare costs through improved public health.  AECON,2012 Through this article, we have seen more effects of heat island effect on the economy. By combining policy and economic factors, I can reflect and study heat island effect in a more comprehensive way.\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that the government’s approach to global warming from the heat island effect is a win-all strategy. It can not only improve the urban environment and improve the quality of life of residents, but also bring economic savings and benefits, especially in reducing energy consumption, improving public health and promoting green urban planning. Before I came into contact with the direction of environmental protection, I was always confused about the solution to the problem of global warming, because I felt that it was a very general plan, and the government did not know what kind of city-wide measures to improve the greenhouse effect. Therefore, after learning the term UHI, I have more ideas for policy makers and urban planners to incorporate measures to mitigate the heat island effect into urban development and climate change adaptation strategies, start from the comfort of people’s lives, and work up and down to solve the greenhouse effect in a more efficient way.\n纽约市：宜居的气候，气候变暖对高原植被的影响\n通过遥感来检测监测气候变化，全球目标C40,\n新加坡热环境，2050年实现0碳 green plan，它相应了\n方法：增加绿地面积，改变建筑布局（减少空调使用）——城市规划解决热效应\n局部气候问题，城市形态+建成环境landcover（分类）\n连续变量，没有必要做这个植被分类变量，单纯分析他们的相关关系\n我们可以做的：通过遥感计算热环境的公式，存在这个变量；LCC和热岛之间的关系\noptional：urban fall和经济效应联合起来，会不会对热岛效应的研究有变化\nps：提出假设（比如高层建筑影响热环境），做出分析，拿着结果去找政策对应，一切研究最终要回归政策，最终呈现的结果要很简单（高层建筑会影响热环境，且响应了政策的某部分（作为reference）\n海岸线侵蚀，植被，预测\n关键词：urban island；\n竞标：做的东西简单——结果又要有效"

Additionally, a subsidy program will be implemented to offset the cost of air conditioning for eligible individuals, promoting social equity during extreme temperature events.\n\nEnvironmental Conservation and Greening Efforts:\n\nAn increase in the number of verdant thoroughfares will be pursued, enhancing the urban canopy and vegetation density. This will be complemented by an ambitious urban forestry initiative aimed at the establishment and expansion of parklands to foster biodiversity, improve air quality, and enhance the urban dwellers’ quality of life.\n\nThese strategic measures align with contemporary urban resilience and sustainability frameworks, aiming to holistically address the urban heat island phenomenon and promote a healthier, more sustainable urban environment.\nThen I collect them and make one Hazard-Vulnerability Risk Map."
