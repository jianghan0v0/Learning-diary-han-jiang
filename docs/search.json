    "text": "Introduction\nHello! I’m HAN JIANG. I’m currently pursuing my graduate studies at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) at UCL, marking my first foray into postgraduate education. My journey at UCL has been enriching, having completed courses in the Foundations of Spatial Data Science, Geographic Information Systems, Urban Systems Theory, Science, and Quantitative Methods. I’m currently delving into Remote Sensing, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), Data Science, and Building Spatial Applications with Big Data, which are broadening my perspective and skill set in the spatial sciences.\nI graduated in 2023 with a Bachelor’s degree from a collaborative program between Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Queen Mary University of London in E-commerce Engineering with Law. My undergraduate studies encompassed a diverse array of subjects including Advanced Network Programming, Engineering Mathematics, Discrete Mathematics, Advanced Mathematics, Telecommunications Engineering, Web Front-end Design, Databases, and Macroeconomics.\nMy internship experiences have been equally diverse and enriching. In 2022, I interned at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I was involved in projects related to Monkey Behavior Image Recognition and Mouse Behavior Recording, focusing mainly on video data annotation and model testing. In 2023, I took up a community operations role at EasyTransfer, where my primary responsibility was addressing and resolving user product inquiries and issues.\nOn a lighter note, here’s a bit more about me beyond academics and work: I’m a Leo born in the 2000s with an ENTP personality type. My hobbies include visiting parks (easy to get tired), exploring museums (easy to get lost), enjoying a drink (easy to be drunk), indulging in gourmet food (on a budget), and watching musicals (even as I struggle with English). I’ve been trying to become a blogger, but I have very few followers. I love dogs, especially my HuanHuan, who is 10 years old now. I miss her so much.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"

Here are how EM waves interact with Specific Atmospheric Components:\n-Water Vapor: Absorbs infrared and microwave radiation, playing a significant role in the Earth’s energy balance.\n-Ozone: Absorbs most of the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation, protecting living organisms.\n-Aerosols and Particulates: Scatter and absorb sunlight, which can cool the surface or contribute to atmospheric warming, depending on their properties."

    "text": "2.3 Practical Applications\n\n2.3.1 Introduction to Tools:\n1. Loading Landsat and Sentinel Data\n\nLandsat and Sentinel are two different Earth observation satellite programs. The Landsat program is managed jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA and has been operational since 1972, making it the longest-running enterprise for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. The Sentinel program is part of the European Space Agency (ESA) and supports the European Union’s Copernicus program, providing a wide range of data for environmental and security monitoring.\nLoading the data involves retrieving these satellites’ imagery from databases or storage services. This may include specifying certain criteria like specific dates, areas of interest, cloud cover percentage, etc., to filter the data.\n\n2. Selecting Regions of Interest (ROIs)\n\nSelecting Regions of Interest (ROIs) is the process of identifying areas for focused analysis within the vast amounts of remote sensing data. These areas might be selected based on specific geographic features, ecosystems, urban areas, etc.\nROIs can be selected by manually drawing polygons, entering geographic coordinates, or using existing geographic information data (like vector layers). This step is crucial to ensure that subsequent analyses are concentrated on relevant areas.\n\n3. Plotting Spectral Signatures\n\nSpectral signatures refer to the characteristic pattern of reflection or absorption of light at different wavelengths by objects or materials. In remote sensing, analyzing the spectral reflectance of different terrestrial materials (like vegetation, water bodies, soil, etc.) allows for their identification and classification.\nPlotting spectral signatures involves graphically representing these spectral characteristics, typically showing wavelength (or bands) against reflectance values. This helps in understanding the spectral behavior of different materials, which is vital for applications like material classification, vegetation health analysis, etc.\nApplications of Remote Sensing: Covers urban/green space coverage, pollution studies, illegal logging, forest fires, temperature studies, flooding, disaster response, and building footprints analysis."

It underscores the complexity and richness of remotely sensed data, advocating for a nuanced approach to data interpretation and application in various geographical and environmental studies.\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Summary\nThis lecture provides a comprehensive overview of the techniques and challenges involved in processing remote sensing data. Through detailed explanations of correction methods, data joining techniques, and enhancements, students gain insights into the meticulous work required to transform raw satellite imagery into valuable information for a wide range of applications."
