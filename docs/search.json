    "text": "Introduction\n\n\n\nHello! I’m HAN JIANG. I’m currently pursuing my graduate studies at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) at UCL, marking my first foray into postgraduate education. My journey at UCL has been enriching, having completed courses in the Foundations of Spatial Data Science, Geographic Information Systems, Urban Systems Theory, Science, and Quantitative Methods. I’m currently delving into Remote Sensing, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), Data Science, and Building Spatial Applications with Big Data, which are broadening my perspective and skill set in the spatial sciences.\nI graduated in 2023 with a Bachelor’s degree from a collaborative program between Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Queen Mary University of London in E-commerce Engineering with Law. My undergraduate studies encompassed a diverse array of subjects including Advanced Network Programming, Engineering Mathematics, Discrete Mathematics, Advanced Mathematics, Telecommunications Engineering, Web Front-end Design, Databases, and Macroeconomics.\nMy internship experiences have been equally diverse and enriching. In 2022, I interned at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I was involved in projects related to Monkey Behavior Image Recognition and Mouse Behavior Recording, focusing mainly on video data annotation and model testing. In 2023, I took up a community operations role at EasyTransfer, where my primary responsibility was addressing and resolving user product inquiries and issues.\nOn a lighter note, here’s a bit more about me beyond academics and work: I’m a Leo born in the 2000s with an ENTP personality type. My hobbies include visiting parks (easy to get tired), exploring museums (easy to get lost), enjoying a drink (easy to be drunk), indulging in gourmet food (on a budget), and watching musicals (even as I struggle with English). I’ve been trying to become a blogger, but I have very few followers. I love dogs, especially my HuanHuan, who is 10 years old now. I miss her so much."

    "text": "1.2 Practical Applications\n\n1.2.1 Types of Sensors:\nPassive sensors detect reflected energy from the sun, while active sensors emit electromagnetic waves and wait for the reflection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Introduction to Tools:\n1. Loading Landsat and Sentinel Data\n\nLandsat and Sentinel are two different Earth observation satellite programs. The Landsat program is managed jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA and has been operational since 1972, making it the longest-running enterprise for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. The Sentinel program is part of the European Space Agency (ESA) and supports the European Union’s Copernicus program, providing a wide range of data for environmental and security monitoring.\nLoading the data involves retrieving these satellites’ imagery from databases or storage services. This may include specifying certain criteria like specific dates, areas of interest, cloud cover percentage, etc., to filter the data.\n\n2. Selecting Regions of Interest (ROIs)\n\nSelecting Regions of Interest (ROIs) is the process of identifying areas for focused analysis within the vast amounts of remote sensing data. These areas might be selected based on specific geographic features, ecosystems, urban areas, etc.\nROIs can be selected by manually drawing polygons, entering geographic coordinates, or using existing geographic information data (like vector layers). This step is crucial to ensure that subsequent analyses are concentrated on relevant areas.\n\n3. Plotting Spectral Signatures\n\nSpectral signatures refer to the characteristic pattern of reflection or absorption of light at different wavelengths by objects or materials. In remote sensing, analyzing the spectral reflectance of different terrestrial materials (like vegetation, water bodies, soil, etc.) allows for their identification and classification.\nPlotting spectral signatures involves graphically representing these spectral characteristics, typically showing wavelength (or bands) against reflectance values. This helps in understanding the spectral behavior of different materials, which is vital for applications like material classification, vegetation health analysis, etc.\nApplications of Remote Sensing: Covers urban/green space coverage, pollution studies, illegal logging, forest fires, temperature studies, flooding, disaster response, and building footprints analysis."

    "section": "6.1 Introduction",
    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nIn this week, we delved into how classified data is utilized and the various methods for classifying remotely sensed data.\nHere are some common indicators:\n\nLULC: Land Use/Land Cover LULC impacts air pollution levels through various pathways, with different land cover types affecting the atmospheric conditions in distinct ways. For instance, urban areas, with their dense construction and reduced green spaces, tend to have higher levels of air pollution. Construction lands, in particular, are associated with increased levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) due to both the nature of construction activities and the increased vehicular traffic they attract.(Int. J,2021)\nCART: The Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm is a decision tree learning technique that can be used for both classification and regression predictive modeling problems. It works by repeatedly splitting the data into two child datasets, which form the branches of the tree, based on the feature that results in the highest reduction of impurity. Impurity is measured using criteria such as the Gini index for classification tasks or mean squared error for regression tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: How the CART Algorithm Powers Decision Trees in Data Science https://dataaspirant.com/cart-algorithm/)\n\n\n\n\nCART is known for its versatility, as it handles both categorical and continuous data types and automatically selects the most informative features. However, it is sensitive to changes in the data, can overfit if not properly pruned, and its binary splits may not always be the most efficient representation, especially for categorical data with multiple levels.(Krzywinski, M., Altman, N,2017)\n\nImage classification: Remote Sensing Classification involves converting every pixel in an image to a pre-defined category through supervised (pattern recognition or machine learning) or unsupervised (clustering) procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Sumit Singh,2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Vector Machine: SVM is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for classification and regression tasks. Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik and colleagues, SVMs operate on the principle of finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes in the feature space. This is achieved through a process known as the kernel trick, which allows SVM to perform non-linear classification by implicitly mapping inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces."

It explores the utilization of MODIS and SAR data to monitor flood events, emphasizing the interpretation of these datasets to assess flood impact. The lecture covers the importance of understanding spectral signatures associated with floods, especially in terms of backscatter in SAR data, which is key in differentiating flooded from non-flooded areas.\n\n8.1.1 Backscatter in SAR\nDefinition: Refers to the portion of the radar signal that is reflected back to the SAR satellite from Earth’s surface.\n\nFlood Detection: Utilizes the contrast in backscatter between water and land; water surfaces typically appear dark in SAR imagery due to low backscatter.\nSurface Interaction: The intensity of backscatter is influenced by surface roughness and moisture levels; smoother surfaces like water bodies tend to have lower backscatter.\nAdvantages of SAR:\n\nCloud Penetration: Can acquire data in all weather conditions, essential for timely flood monitoring.\nIllumination Independence: Capable of data collection during both day and night.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 SAR vs. LST\n\nLST measures the temperature of the Earth’s surface, valuable for studying climate change, urban heat islands, and agriculture.\nSAR is a form of radar imagery that can penetrate cloud cover and is not dependent on sunlight, making it ideal for monitoring Earth’s surface in any weather and lighting conditions. SAR is particularly useful for detecting structural changes, such as deforestation, floods, and earthquakes, due to its ability to measure surface roughness.\n\nThe key difference lies in LST providing thermal information, while SAR offers structural details."

It clusters pixels by performing local K-means optimization within a five-dimensional space (color and spatial coordinates). The charm of SLIC is that it is simple and efficient, requiring only two input parameters: the number of superpixels required and the compactness factor that controls the compactness of the superpixels. However, the difficulty of learning SLIC lies in understanding its iterative process and how to select the appropriate parameters to achieve the best segmentation effect. In addition, SLIC requires multiple iterations to converge during processing, which means that time efficiency can be a challenge when working with very large image sets.\nHowever, SNIC offers a faster and less memory-intensive segmentation method than SLIC. By updating the center of mass directly in a single iteration and explicitly enforcing connectivity from the start, SNIC effectively addresses some of the limitations that exist with SLIC. I think the main difficulty in learning SNIC is to understand how it uses the priority queue to select the next pixel to be added to the cluster, and the process of updating the center of mass online."

So, what can be done to make up for this disadvantage? I made the following summary: * First method I recommand is machine deep learning, use advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms can extract useful information from lower resolution data, improving the accuracy of classification and recognition. * Secondly, combining data from different sources and resolutions, such as combining high-resolution optical images with radar data, can improve the accuracy and robustness of the analysis. It’s inevitable to meet many difficulties in the application of OBIA,\nAnd for pixel-based analysis, sub-pixel and super-pixel, it’s interesting to summarize their peculiarity and application areas together. Subpixel technology is often used in scenes requiring high precision analysis, such as fine classification of remote sensing images. Superpixel technology is suitable for applications where analysis can be performed efficiently on a larger scale, such as object recognition or scene understanding.

Considering the dynamic nature of urban development and the complexity of defining and identifying slum areas, the paper team chose to apply OBIA to test the slums in different time frames. In three months, the government completed the construction of a road for river inspection.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Jati.P, 2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Jati.P, 2018)\n\n\n\n\nNotably, this essay make TEM as a tool for assessing the temporal transferability of OBIA, which is innovative and insightful!\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Jati.P, 2018)\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the study also reveals that achieving high levels of accuracy and transferability requires careful consideration of local conditions, comprehensive reference data, and potentially, the integration of additional data sources or analytical layers to enhance OBIA’s sensitivity to nuanced urban changes. All in all, these essay is a nice caase study for me to understand how OBIA is applied in a project.

So i read the essay that using the Gaofen-2 high spatial resolution imagery to compare sub-pixel and super-pixel strategies for mapping urban and rural greenspaces.\nWeida Yin and Jian Yang(2016) explores the comparative effectiveness of sub-pixel and super-pixel strategies in mapping urban greenspaces using high-resolution satellite imagery.\nFor this figure, we can see from upper to lower the pictures represent multispectral imagery, sub-pixel result, super-pixel result. We can see that in the second row, the sub-pixel detects a mix of different features in one pixel and tries to quantify their respective proportions. The third line, as a superpixel result, shows that the image is split into larger blocks where the pixels within these blocks are similar in some properties and can therefore be processed as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Weida.Y, 2016)\n\n\n\n\nFrom this study, we can summarize their differences. First, in terms of resolution and detail, subpixel analysis can provide details beyond traditional pixel grids, while superpixels focus more on the similarity between pixels and the integrity of the region. Second, in terms of application purpose, subpixel method is more suitable for accurate detection and measurement, such as edge detection or fine feature classification. Superpixels are suitable for image segmentation and structured representation, which helps to improve the efficiency of subsequent analysis.\nFakhereh.A, 2015 Weida.Y, 2017"

For instance, urban areas, with their dense construction and reduced green spaces, tend to have higher levels of air pollution. Construction lands, in particular, are associated with increased levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) due to both the nature of construction activities and the increased vehicular traffic they attract.(Int. J,2021)\nCART: The Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm is a decision tree learning technique that can be used for both classification and regression predictive modeling problems. It works by repeatedly splitting the data into two child datasets, which form the branches of the tree, based on the feature that results in the highest reduction of impurity. Impurity is measured using criteria such as the Gini index for classification tasks or mean squared error for regression tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: How the CART Algorithm Powers Decision Trees in Data Science https://dataaspirant.com/cart-algorithm/)\n\n\n\n\nCART is known for its versatility, as it handles both categorical and continuous data types and automatically selects the most informative features. However, it is sensitive to changes in the data, can overfit if not properly pruned, and its binary splits may not always be the most efficient representation, especially for categorical data with multiple levels.(Krzywinski, M., Altman, N,2017)\n\nImage classification: Remote Sensing Classification involves converting every pixel in an image to a pre-defined category through supervised (pattern recognition or machine learning) or unsupervised (clustering) procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Sumit Singh,2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Vector Machine: SVM is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for classification and regression tasks. Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik and colleagues, SVMs operate on the principle of finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes in the feature space. This is achieved through a process known as the kernel trick, which allows SVM to perform non-linear classification by implicitly mapping inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces."

    "text": "7.3 Further study-Segmentation\n\nIn a further exploration of image segmentation techniques, I delved into two very interesting techniques by reading the literature: Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) and its improved version, Simple Non-Iterative Clustering(SNIC).\nSLIC was the first superpixel segmentation algorithm I came across. It clusters pixels by performing local K-means optimization within a five-dimensional space (color and spatial coordinates). The charm of SLIC is that it is simple and efficient, requiring only two input parameters: the number of superpixels required and the compactness factor that controls the compactness of the superpixels. However, the difficulty of learning SLIC lies in understanding its iterative process and how to select the appropriate parameters to achieve the best segmentation effect. In addition, SLIC requires multiple iterations to converge during processing, which means that time efficiency can be a challenge when working with very large image sets.\nHowever, SNIC offers a faster and less memory-intensive segmentation method than SLIC. By updating the center of mass directly in a single iteration and explicitly enforcing connectivity from the start, SNIC effectively addresses some of the limitations that exist with SLIC. I think the main difficulty in learning SNIC is to understand how it uses the priority queue to select the next pixel to be added to the cluster, and the process of updating the center of mass online."

The Landsat program is managed jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA and has been operational since 1972, making it the longest-running enterprise for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. The Sentinel program is part of the European Space Agency (ESA) and supports the European Union’s Copernicus program, providing a wide range of data for environmental and security monitoring.\nLoading the data involves retrieving these satellites’ imagery from databases or storage services. This may include specifying certain criteria like specific dates, areas of interest, cloud cover percentage, etc., to filter the data.\n\n2. Selecting Regions of Interest (ROIs)\n\nSelecting Regions of Interest (ROIs) is the process of identifying areas for focused analysis within the vast amounts of remote sensing data. These areas might be selected based on specific geographic features, ecosystems, urban areas, etc.\nROIs can be selected by manually drawing polygons, entering geographic coordinates, or using existing geographic information data (like vector layers). This step is crucial to ensure that subsequent analyses are concentrated on relevant areas.\n\n3. Plotting Spectral Signatures\n\nSpectral signatures refer to the characteristic pattern of reflection or absorption of light at different wavelengths by objects or materials. In remote sensing, analyzing the spectral reflectance of different terrestrial materials (like vegetation, water bodies, soil, etc.) allows for their identification and classification.\nPlotting spectral signatures involves graphically representing these spectral characteristics, typically showing wavelength (or bands) against reflectance values. This helps in understanding the spectral behavior of different materials, which is vital for applications like material classification, vegetation health analysis, etc.\nApplications of Remote Sensing: Covers urban/green space coverage, pollution studies, illegal logging, forest fires, temperature studies, flooding, disaster response, and building footprints analysis."

Comparing to SNAP and QGIS, GEE is really efficieny and helpful cause it doesn’t need download and process images, which is really annoying. ### Introduction Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cutting-edge cloud-based platform for planetary-scale environmental data analysis. By offering an extensive archive of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, coupled with powerful computing resources, GEE enables scientists, researchers, and developers to conduct analyses at unprecedented scales.\nGEE Guidance\n\n\n5.1.1 PCA\nPCA is a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most variability.\n\nPCA in GEE: PCA is usually performed in GEE to reduce the dimensionality of remote sensing data and to highlight key information about land cover, change detection, or other environmental features.\nPCA in R: Compared with GEE, the data processing capability of R is limited by local computing resources. While R can handle big data, dealing with particularly large data sets may require optimizing code or using specific packages such as bigmemory or ff to manage memory usage.\n\nAlthough PCA in GEE and R are used for data reduction and feature extraction, GEE is more suitable for processing large-scale remote sensing image data and geospatial analysis, while R provides more flexible data processing and statistical analysis tools, which are suitable for various types of data."
