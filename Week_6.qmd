## Extracurricular study

In this week, my group decide the specific city and main topic to study: the Urban Heat Island issues in Hongkung. So here I collect current policy and global policy that could support our study.

### Current Policy: Hongkong Climate Action Blueprint 2050

To follow up and review the design standards related to public infrastructure and government buildings, which is expected to be substantially completed by 2023. Further promote green building design and sustainable built environment. Promoting urban forestry and increasing afforestation has not helped to reduce urban temperatures and alleviate the heat island effect (Environment and Ecology Bureau, 2023).

### Global Policy

1.  United Nations' The New Urban Agenda includes a commitment to reduce the financial, environmental and public health costs of the heat island effect.

2.  Beating the Heat: A Sustainable Cooling Handbook for Cites has made mitigating urban heat island effect one of its goals.

3.  The Cool Cities Network proposes to mitigate the urban heat island effect by reducing urban temperatures through the use of cooling surfaces, alternative materials and designs, and green infrastructure.

4.The Paris Agreement aims to combat climate change globally, indirectly supporting efforts to mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effects through its emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing adaptation strategies.
