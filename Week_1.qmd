# Week 1 - Introduction to Remote Sensing

## 1.1 Summary

The summary of lecture 1 will be provided in a hand drawn mind map as shown below, as I find mind maps really useful for over viewing topics! The week 1 lecture covered the basics of remote sensing and what it is used for.

## 1.2 Remotely sensed data-Four solutions

1.  Spatial = the size of the raster grid per pixel (e.g. 20cm or 30m)

2.  Spectral = the number of bands it records data in...more soon

3.  Temporal = the time it revisits (e.g. daily, every 7 days, on demand ✈️)

4.  Radiometric = identify differences in light or reflectance, in practice this is the range of possible values.

    an 8 bit sensor has values between 0 and 255 (256 possibilities) an 11 bit sensor has values between 0 and 2047(2048 possibilities)
