# Week 1 - Introduction to Remote Sensing

## Lecture Content

-   **Remote Sensing Definition**: NASA defines it as acquiring information from a distance, using sensors mounted on platforms like satellites, planes, drones, and phones.

-   **Types of Sensors**: Passive sensors detect reflected energy from the sun, while active sensors emit electromagnetic waves and wait for the reflection.

-   **Data Interaction and Scattering**: Interaction with Earth's surface and atmospheric scattering (Rayleigh, Mie, Non-selective) affects the data.

-   **Spatial Junk Issue**: The volume of spacecraft and sensors has led to concerns about space debris tracked by NASA.

## Four Resolutions

-   **Spatial**: Size of raster cells varies from 10cm to several kilometers.

-   **Spectral**: Number of bands recorded, influenced by atmospheric windows.

-   **Temporal**: Frequency of sensor revisits, affecting data freshness.

-   **Radiometric**: Sensor's ability to differentiate small energy differences, measured in bit depth (e.g., 8-bit, 256 values).

## Practical Applications

-   **Introduction to Practical Tools**: Loading Landsat and Sentinel data, exploring SNAP and R, selecting regions of interest, and plotting spectral signatures.

-   **Applications of Remote Sensing**: Covers urban/green space coverage, pollution studies, illegal logging, forest fires, temperature studies, flooding, disaster response, and building footprints analysis.

## Summary

The field of remote sensing is essential for understanding and managing environmental hazards, especially in the context of urban sustainability and climate change. The module provides comprehensive training in using remote sensing data and tools for environmental analysis and decision-making.
