## Four Resolution

Remotely sensed data and applications will vary based on the four resolutions:

1. Spatial = the size of the raster grid per pixel (e.g. 20cm or 30m)
1. Spectral = the number of bands it records data in...more soon
1. Temporal = the time it revisits (e.g. daily, every 7 days, on demand ✈️)
1. Radiometric = identify differences in light or reflectance, in practice this is the range of possible values.
  * an 8 bit sensor has values between 0 and 255 (256 possibilities)
  * an 11 bit sensor has values between 0 and 2047(2048 possibilities)
