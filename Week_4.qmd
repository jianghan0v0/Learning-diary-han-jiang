### Current Policy: Hongkong Climate Action Blueprint 2050

To follow up and review the design standards related to public infrastructure and government buildings, which is expected to be substantially completed by 2023. Further promote green building design and sustainable built environment. Promoting urban forestry and increasing afforestation has not helped to reduce urban temperatures and alleviate the heat island effect (Environment and Ecology Bureau, 2023).

### Global Policy

1.  United Nations' The New Urban Agenda includes a commitment to reduce the financial, environmental and public health costs of the heat island effect.

2.  Beating the Heat: A Sustainable Cooling Handbook for Cites has made mitigating urban heat island effect one of its goals.

3.  The Cool Cities Network proposes to mitigate the urban heat island effect by reducing urban temperatures through the use of cooling surfaces, alternative materials and designs, and green infrastructure.

4.  The Paris Agreement aims to combat climate change globally, indirectly supporting efforts to mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effects through its emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing adaptation strategies.

### Project Objectives

Reduce surface and atmospheric temperatures in densely populated areas. Enhance greenery and open spaces using vertical gardens, green roofs, and urban forests. Implement reflective materials in construction to reduce heat absorption. Increase community awareness and involvement in UHI mitigation strategies.[(Siu, L. W., & Hart, M. A. (2013))](https://www.proquest.com/docview/1322482439?pq-origsite=wos&accountid=14511&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals)

### Action Map

The professional articulation of the action plan derived from the dataset informed by remote sensing analysis could be stated as follows:

**Sustainable Construction Initiatives**:

-   Newly constructed edifices will integrate eco-friendly design principles, targeting certification under the Green Building Environmental Assessment, known as "BEAM Plus," to ensure environmental sustainability and operational efficiency.

**Urban Retrofitting Strategies**:

-   Revitalization projects will involve retrofitting pedestrian pathways and the external surfaces of structures with high-albedo materials, effectively diminishing the surrounding microclimate temperatures through increased solar reflectance.

**Public Space Enhancement Measures**:

-   Infrastructure in densely populated zones and commercial complexes will be augmented with heat mitigation features, including but not limited to pergolas, water features, expansive waterfront promenades, misting systems, and solar-powered evaporative cooling fans.

**Community Welfare and Support Services**:

-   The deployment of sprinkler systems and the provision of public swimming facilities will be instituted as recreational cooling measures. Additionally, a subsidy program will be implemented to offset the cost of air conditioning for eligible individuals, promoting social equity during extreme temperature events.

**Environmental Conservation and Greening Efforts**:

-   An increase in the number of verdant thoroughfares will be pursued, enhancing the urban canopy and vegetation density. This will be complemented by an ambitious urban forestry initiative aimed at the establishment and expansion of parklands to foster biodiversity, improve air quality, and enhance the urban dwellers' quality of life.

These strategic measures align with contemporary urban resilience and sustainability frameworks, aiming to holistically address the urban heat island phenomenon and promote a healthier, more sustainable urban environment.

Then we will collect them and make one **Hazard-Vulnerability Risk** Map.

```

## **Project Management**

We will employ a dedicated project manager to oversee all project activities, 2 Senior Data Analyst, 4 geographic analyst, 1 Hongkong officials and 1 environmental consultant, coordinate with subcontractors, ensure quality control, and adhere to the project schedule. We will use Gantt charts to monitor and manage project progress effectively.

## Application

Out of my interests, I read the essay provided by lecturer, *Economic Assessment of the Urban Heat Island Effect*, and try to figure out the issues raised by UHI.[AECON,2012](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/sitecollectiondocuments/eco-assessment-of-urban-heat-island-effect.pdf)

Firstly, the heat island effect has a significant impact on the urban environment, especially the increase in temperature, which not only affects the health and quality of life of urban residents, but also increases energy consumption and related economic costs. From a government perspective, taking steps to mitigate the heat island effect would not only help combat climate change, but could also lead to economic savings, such as energy savings through reduced air conditioning use and

```

[AECON,2012](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/sitecollectiondocuments/eco-assessment-of-urban-heat-island-effect.pdf)

Through this article, we have seen more effects of heat island effect on the economy. By combining policy and economic factors, I can reflect and study heat island effect in a more comprehensive way.

In Siu's essay, I found this table that summarize data for a study on urban heat islands in Hong Kong, comparing three different locations: the Hong Kong Observatory, Tsak Yue Wu, and Ta Kwu Ling. Each location has a local climate zone designation, descriptions of local and site features, satellite images representing the area, fish-eye photos indicating the extent of the sky unobstructed by buildings or vegetation, and a numerical Sky View Factor (SVF) that quantifies this obstruction.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE, fig.cap="(Source:Siu, L. W.2013)"}
    knitr::include_graphics('https://github.com/jianghan0v0/Learning-diary-han-jiang/raw/main/images/week4-1.png')
```

In the context of a case study on Hong Kong's urban heat island issue, this data would be applied to understand how varying degrees of urbanization and land use influence local climate conditions. The SVF values, in particular, could be crucial in assessing the potential for heat retention in urban areas versus dispersion in more open, rural areas. This is important because areas with lower SVF values tend to trap more heat, contributing to the urban heat island effect. This comparative analysis among different urban and rural stations could provide valuable insights into strategies for mitigating heat through urban planning and the integration of green spaces.

## Reflection

In this week, to better understand how UHI affect cities and i want to figure out how to deal with that, so here I list several ways toitigate the urban heat island effects.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the government's approach to global warming from the heat island effect is a win-all strategy. It can not only improve the urban environment and improve the quality of life of residents, but also bring economic savings and benefits, especially in reducing energy consumption, improving public health and promoting green urban planning. Before I came into contact with the direction of environmental protection, I was always confused about the solution to the problem of global warming, because I felt that it was a very general plan, and the government did not know what kind of city-wide measures to improve the greenhouse effect. Therefore, after learning the term UHI, I have more ideas for policy makers and urban planners to incorporate measures to mitigate the heat island effect into urban development and climate change adaptation strategies, start from the comfort of people's lives, and work up and down to solve the greenhouse effect in a more efficient way.
