## Notebook

## Urban Heat Island(UHI)

UHI is that urban areas obtain comparatively higher atmospheric and surface temperatures than surrounding rural areas. - ![](https://github.com/jianghan0v0/Learning-diary-han-jiang/raw/main/images/uhi.jpg)

### Policy

## Further Study 
Out of my interests, I read the essay provided by lecturer, *Economic Assessment of the Urban Heat Island Effect*, and try to figure out the issues raised by UHI.[AECON,2012](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/sitecollectiondocuments/eco-assessment-of-urban-heat-island-effect.pdf)

Firstly, the heat island effect has a significant impact on the urban environment, especially the increase in temperature, which not only affects the health and quality of life of urban residents, but also increases energy consumption and related economic costs. From a government perspective, taking steps to mitigate the heat island effect would not only help combat climate change, but could also lead to economic savings, such as energy savings through reduced air conditioning use and lower healthcare costs through improved public health.

[AECON,2012](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/sitecollectiondocuments/eco-assessment-of-urban-heat-island-effect.pdf)
Through this article, we have seen more effects of heat island effect on the economy. By combining policy and economic factors, I can reflect and study heat island effect in a more comprehensive way.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the government's approach to global warming from the heat island effect is a win-all strategy. It can not only improve the urban environment and improve the quality of life of residents, but also bring economic savings and benefits, especially in reducing energy consumption, improving public health and promoting green urban planning. Before I came into contact with the direction of environmental protection, I was always confused about the solution to the problem of global warming, because I felt that it was a very general plan, and the government did not know what kind of city-wide measures to improve the greenhouse effect. Therefore, after learning the term UHI, I have more ideas for policy makers and urban planners to incorporate measures to mitigate the heat island effect into urban development and climate change adaptation strategies, start from the comfort of people's lives, and work up and down to solve the greenhouse effect in a more efficient way.
