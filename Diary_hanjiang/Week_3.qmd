Geometric Correction

* SOLUTION 1
Ground Control Points (GPS) match by known points in severval dataset:
  - local map
  - another image
  - GPS data from handheld device

iε + iy2b + ix1b + 0b = y
iε + iy2a + ix1a + 0a = x

* SOLUTION 2
RMSE
- (observed - predicted (the residual))^2
- sum them and divide by number of data points 
- square root that total


Atmospheric correction


Remote sensing jargon
- Digital number(DN): 

-Radiance
- Reflectance
- Reflectance 2
- If/But
All of the light leaving the surface goes straight to the sensor (nothing is intercepted or at an angle) = hemispherical refectance
We need to account for atmospheric and illumination effects to create re
