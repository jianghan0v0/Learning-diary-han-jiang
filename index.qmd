# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Hello! I'm HAN JIANG. I'm currently pursuing my graduate studies at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) at UCL, marking my first foray into postgraduate education. My journey at UCL has been enriching, having completed courses in the Foundations of Spatial Data Science, Geographic Information Systems, Urban Systems Theory, Science, and Quantitative Methods. I'm currently delving into Remote Sensing, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), Data Science, and Building Spatial Applications with Big Data, which are broadening my perspective and skill set in the spatial sciences.

I graduated in 2023 with a Bachelor's degree from a collaborative program between Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Queen Mary University of London in E-commerce Engineering with Law. My undergraduate studies encompassed a diverse array of subjects including Advanced Network Programming, Engineering Mathematics, Discrete Mathematics, Advanced Mathematics, Telecommunications Engineering, Web Front-end Design, Databases, and Macroeconomics.

My internship experiences have been equally diverse and enriching. In 2022, I interned at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I was involved in projects related to Monkey Behavior Image Recognition and Mouse Behavior Recording, focusing mainly on video data annotation and model testing. In 2023, I took up a community operations role at EasyTransfer, where my primary responsibility was addressing and resolving user product inquiries and issues.

On a lighter note, here's a bit more about me beyond academics and work: I'm a Leo born in the 2000s with an ENTP personality type. My hobbies include visiting parks (easy to get tired), exploring museums (easy to get lost), enjoying a drink (easy to be drunk), indulging in gourmet food (on a budget), and watching musicals (even as I struggle with English). I've been trying to become a blogger, but I have very few followers. I love dogs, especially my HuanHuan, who is 10 years old now. I miss her so much.
